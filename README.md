## Game Objects

### Rockets
- **Color**: Different colors for each player (blue, red, green, yellow, magenta)
- **Enhanced Physics**: Acceleration-based movement with realistic momentum and inertia
- **Deadly Vulnerability**: Instantly destroyed by wall contact or black hole collision

- **Gravity Resistance**: Must fight against black hole gravitational pull

### Balls
- **Regular Balls**: Standard targets to push into holes - die instantly if they hit walls
- **Big Balls**: Larger, heavier balls with more mass (appear in higher levels) - also die on wall contact
- **Letter Balls**: Special balls with power-ups (future feature)

### Black Holes
- **Gravitational Pull**: Holes now attract all nearby objects with realistic physics
- **Dual Nature**: Help guide balls to scoring positions but deadly to rockets
- **Visual Effects**: Pulsing animation and gravity field indicators show active gravitational zones
- **Strategic Elements**: Create risk/reward positioning challenges

### Special Objects (Higher Levels)
- **Apples**: Bonus objects
- **Inspectors**: Moving obstacles
- **Lunatics**: Unpredictable moving objects

## Game Modes

### Cooperative Mode
- All players work together to clear levels while surviving the deadly environment
- Shared score and lives
- Progress through increasingly difficult levels with more hazards
- **Extreme Challenge**: Requires teamwork and precision to survive

### Deathmatch Mode (Future Feature)
- Players compete against each other in the hazardous environment
- Last player standing wins
- Wall and black hole deaths still apply
- Environmental hazards become weapons

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Jan Hubicka for creating the original Koules game and making it freely available. KoulesII builds upon the brilliant foundation of the original while adding extreme challenges and enhanced physics that push the gameplay to new levels of difficulty.

The original game inspired a generation of indie game developers and remains a classic example of physics-based gameplay done right. KoulesII honors that legacy while creating an almost impossibly challenging experience that demands absolute precision and strategic thinking.

**Warning**: KoulesII is significantly more difficult than the original Koules. The combination of deadly walls, gravitational black holes, and acceleration-based controls creates an extremely punishing but rewarding gameplay experience.
