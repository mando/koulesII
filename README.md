# Koules - Pixi.js Edition

A modern JavaScript/Pixi.js implementation of the classic Koules game, originally created by Jan Hubicka in 1995.

## About Koules

Koules is a fast-paced physics-based space game where players control rockets to push balls into holes while avoiding collisions. The game features:

- Real-time physics simulation
- Multi-player support (up to 5 players)
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Retro-style graphics and sound effects

## Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Rocket Control**: Navigate your rocket using thrust in any direction
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic collision detection and momentum physics
- **Ball Management**: Push balls into holes to score points
- **Progressive Levels**: Increasing difficulty with more balls and obstacles
- **Multi-player**: Support for 1-5 players simultaneously

### Technical Features
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ modules and async/await
- **Pixi.js Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
- **Web Audio API**: Dynamic sound generation
- **Responsive Design**: Scales to different screen sizes
- **Cross-platform**: Runs in any modern web browser

## Controls

### Player 1
- **Arrow Keys**: Move rocket
- **Spacebar**: Brake/Reverse thrust

### Player 2
- **WASD**: Move rocket
- **Left Shift**: Brake/Reverse thrust

### Player 3
- **IJKL**: Move rocket
- **U**: Brake/Reverse thrust

### Player 4
- **Numpad 8,4,6,2**: Move rocket
- **Numpad 0**: Brake/Reverse thrust

### Player 5
- **TFGH**: Move rocket
- **R**: Brake/Reverse thrust

### Global Controls
- **ESC**: Pause/Menu
- **R**: Restart level (during gameplay)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Setup
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mac-koules/koules-pixijs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Game Objects
